# T-Det-D

## Background
Image classifiers model for detecting teeth diseases is an image classification project that aims to predict the user's dental class. This project only involves two learning paths, namely machine learning (4) and cloud computing (2). This project also produces two outputs, namely models and APIs. In making the model, there are three models made, namely the model predicting the front view of the teeth, the model predicting the top view, and the model predicting the bottom view.
